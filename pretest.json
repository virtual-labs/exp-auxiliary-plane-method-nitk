      "question": "What are the non-parallel and non-intersecting line called ________",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Spiral line",
        "b": "Parallel line",
        "c": "Skew line",
        "d": "Perpendicular line"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (c). A spiral line refers to a curve which emanates from a point, moving farther away as it revolves around the point. It is a subtype of whorled patterns, a broad group that also includes concentric objects. ",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). Parallel lines are two or more lines that are always the same distance apart and never intersect, even if they are extended infinitely in both directions. They are always equidistant and run in the same direction, which means they have the same slope.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). Non-parallel and non-intersecting lines are called skew lines. Skew lines exist only in three-dimensional or higher-dimensional space. They are neither parallel nor intersecting, meaning they do not lie in the same plane. This is in contrast to parallel lines, which never intersect no matter how far they are extended, and intersecting lines, which meet at a common point.",
        "d": "The right answer is (c). Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect each other at a right angle, which is 90 degrees. This property of lines is known as perpendicularity."

      "question": "The plane appears as a foreshortened surface in all the projection planes is known as ________.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Parallel plane",
        "b": "Vertical plane",
        "c": "Slant plane",
        "d": "Horizontal plane"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (c). When a plane is parallel to a projection plane, it appears in its true shape and size. However, when a plane is inclined or slanted, it is not parallel to any of the projection planes. As a result, the plane appears foreshortened, meaning it appears shorter than it actually is due to the angle of view.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). When a plane is parallel to a projection plane, it appears in its true shape and size. However, when a plane is inclined or slanted, it is not parallel to any of the projection planes. As a result, the plane appears foreshortened, meaning it appears shorter than it actually is due to the angle of view.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). A slant plane is defined as a plane that appears as a line in at least one of the standard views of projection (top, front), and foreshortened in the other views.",
        "d": "The right answer is (c). When a plane is parallel to a projection plane, it appears in its true shape and size. However, when a plane is inclined or slanted, it is not parallel to any of the projection planes. As a result, the plane appears foreshortened, meaning it appears shorter than it actually is due to the angle of view."
