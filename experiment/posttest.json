      "question": "To save space on drawing or to save time _______ view may be",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Half auxiliary",
        "b": "Full auxiliary",
        "c": "Front",
        "d": "Top"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). Engineering drawings often need to represent complex 3D objects on a 2D plane. This can result in a cluttered drawing if full views are used for every aspect of the object. By using half auxiliary views, we can represent the necessary information while using less space on the drawing. Creating full auxiliary views can be time-consuming, especially for complex objects. Half auxiliary views can convey the same amount of information in less time, making the drawing process more efficient.",
        "b": "The right answer is (a). Creating full auxiliary views can be time-consuming, especially for complex objects. Half auxiliary views can convey the same amount of information in less time, making the drawing process more efficient.",
        "c": "The right answer is (a). Auxiliary views are often used when the front view does not adequately show all the details of the object. If a certain feature of the object is not clearly visible or is obscured in the front view, a half auxiliary view can be used to highlight that feature.",
        "d": "The right answer is (a). Auxiliary views are used to show the true shape and size of an inclined surface, which may not be accurately represented in the top view."

      "question": "Auxiliary views tend to make use of ________ projection.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Orthographic",
        "b": "Axonometric",
        "c": "Oblique",
        "d": "Isometric"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). Each view of orthographic projection shows only one side of the object. It preserves both distances and angles, but there can be many hidden surfaces that are not clearly visible. While axonometric projection is a type of orthographic projection used for creating a pictorial drawing of an object, where the object is rotated around one or more of its axes relative to the projection plane to reveal multiple sides.",
        "b": "Correct, the right answer is (b). Axonometric projection is a type of orthographic projection used for creating a pictorial drawing of an object, where the lines of sight are perpendicular to the plane of projection, and the object is rotated around one or more of its axes to reveal multiple sides.",
        "c": "The right answer is (b). An oblique projection is a drawing in which the observer is considered to be at infinity, and the plane of projection is parallel to the front surface of the object. Axonometric projections are considered more realistic than oblique projections. The horizontal edges of an object in axonometric projections are parallel to each other and inclined to the plane.",
        "d": "The right answer is (b). While isometric projections maintain the same scale on all axes, this might not always provide the most accurate representation of the object. Axonometric projections, on the other hand, can adjust the scale on different axes, allowing for a more accurate depiction of the true shape and size of the object."

      "question": "In _________ the parallel projection rays are not perpendicular to the viewing plane as with orthographic projection but strike the projection plane at an angle other than 90 degrees.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Isometric projections",
        "b": "Orthographic projections",
        "c": "Axonometric projection",
        "d": "Oblique projection"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (d). Oblique sketches put more focus on the face or front of an object. On the other hand, isometric sketches or projections put more focus on the edge of an object and are drawn using a 30-degree angle. They keep the measurements proportional, providing a more realistic representation of the object. However, they might be more complex to construct, especially for objects with intricate details or complex geometries.",
        "b": "The right answer is (d). Orthographic projections are a type of parallel projection where the projection lines are perpendicular to the plane of projection. They preserve both distances and angles, but there can be many hidden surfaces that are not clearly visible. Orthographic projections are typically used when the goal is to show precise dimensions and angles.",
        "c": "The right answer is (d). Axonometric projections are considered more realistic than oblique projections. The horizontal edges of an object in axonometric projections are parallel to each other and inclined to the plane. Whereas in oblique projections only one or two faces have true shape and size.",
        "d": "Correct, the right answer is (d). The use of oblique projection and the specific angle at which the projection rays strike the plane depend on the specific needs of the drawing and the object being represented. The goal is always to provide the clearest, most accurate, and most useful representation of the object."

      "question": "The front and top view sometimes are not sufficient to convey all the information regarding the object. Additional views are therefore projected on other planes known as ________.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Auxiliary vertical plane",
        "b": "Auxiliary inclined plane",
        "c": "Auxiliary plane",
        "d": "Horizontal & Vertical plane"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (c). An AVP is perpendicular to the Horizontal Plane (HP) and inclined to the Vertical Plane (VP). The view of the object projected on the AVP is called an auxiliary front view. The AVP is used when the true shape of a feature, which is perpendicular to the HP and inclined to the VP, needs to be represented.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). An AIP is perpendicular to the Vertical Plane (VP) and inclined to the Horizontal Plane (HP). The view of the object projected on the AIP is called an auxiliary top view. The AIP is used when the true shape of a feature, which is perpendicular to the VP and inclined to the HP, needs to be represented.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). Auxiliary views are used to show the true shape and size of an inclined surface, which may not be accurately represented in the front or top view. Auxiliary views can provide additional perspectives that are not possible with just the front and top views. They can help in visualizing the object more accurately and completely.",
        "d": "The right answer is (c). HP and VP are reference plane used for drawing views."

        "c": "0 deg",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). An AVP is perpendicular to HP. So, the angle is 90 deg.",
        "b": "The right answer is (a). An AVP is perpendicular to HP. So, the angle is 90 deg and it cannot be 180 deg.",
        "c": "The right answer is (a). An AVP is perpendicular to HP. So, the angle is 90 deg and it cannot be 0 deg.",
        "d": "The right answer is (a). An AVP is perpendicular to HP. So, the angle is 90 deg and it cannot be any angle."
